Note:  This program has been tested and works with the ATtiny85 set to either 8MHz or 1MHz.  It may work okay
at 16HMz, I just haven't tested it at the clock speed.  The goal was minimal power consumption.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR 1MHz OPERATION:  I've found that at 1MHz it is necessary to disable I2C BUS 
arbitration detection by commenting the statement "#define BUS_ARBITRATION" in TinyTWI.h.  It's probably 
a good idea to disable this at all clock speeds.  (There are no other masters on the BUS)
