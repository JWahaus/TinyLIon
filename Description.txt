  An AtTiny85 based Lithium-Ion battery voltage boost, monitor, and protection circuit.  These types of devices are
  sometimes referred to as Power Banks or Portable Chargers.

  This circuit allows the use of a 3.7V Lithium-Ion battery cell, such as the popular 18650 cells, to power or charge
  5.0V (or higher) devices and provides voltage regulation and over discharge protection.   A flashing red LED is used
  to indicate when the battery is getting low.  Once the battery voltage dips below the desired cut-off voltage, the
  micro-controller disconnects the battery from the output terminals.

  An optional LCD display can be attached to monitor and display the Battery and Output voltages in real time.  The
  DC boost module used for stepping up the battery's output voltage is rated at 2A and can boost the output voltage as
  high as 28V if desired.  The boost module has a potentiometer for adjusting the output voltage.  When using the LCD
  connector the output voltage should be kept between 4.5V and 7.0V since the LCD is directly powered from the boost
  module's generated output voltage.

  Some practical guidance when using this circuit:  Although the boost module in this circuit is rated at 2A it is
  likely not a good idea to draw this much current continuously when using this module as it will get very hot as you
  approach the module's upper limits.   Keep in mind when calculating current draw that the battery's current draw will
  be higher than the output current.  For example if the output is using 5V at 1 amp (5 watts of power) then the boost
  module (assuming 90% efficiency) is using 1.5 amps at 3.7 volts.
